**PaperPilot** is a next-generation research assistant designed to streamline your academic workflow. By integrating advanced AI capabilities with a robust document management system, PaperPilot helps you discover, read, understand, and manage research papers more efficiently than ever before.

Whether you are tracking the latest ArXiv preprints or deep-diving into complex PDFs, PaperPilot acts as your intelligent co-pilot.

> **Note**: This project was built using **Trae Coding Agent** via **Vibe Coding**, leveraging two models (**Gemini-3-Pro-Preview** for feature development and **GPT-5.2** for bug fixes and performance optimization). It is truly incredible for someone like me who hasn't written modern Web frontend code 🤯 (the last time I wrote Web code was manually coding HTML and CSS during my undergraduate years).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JS (Responsive)
- **Database**: SQLite (Metadata), Supabase (Optional Auth)
- **AI Core**:
  - [MinerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU) (High-fidelity PDF parsing)
  - [BabelDOC](https://github.com/funstory-ai/BabelDOC) (Document Translation)
  - OpenAI-compatible LLM Interface

## 🚀 Installation

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast and reliable dependency management.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- `uv` package manager

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flyflypeng/PaperPilot
   cd PaperPilot
   ```

2. **Initialize Environment**
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   # .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   
   **Option A: Standard (Client-only)**
   Suitable if you use external APIs for AI tasks.
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e ".[local]"
   ```

   **Option B: Full Server (Local AI)**
   Includes dependencies for local MinerU and VLM inference.
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e ".[server]"
   ```

4. **Supabase Auth (Required in production)**
   PaperPilot uses Supabase Email/Password authentication. API mutations require a Bearer token; validated browser sessions also receive an HttpOnly cookie so protected PDFs, thumbnails, and downloads can load normally. Production starts fail-closed and requires both Supabase values plus an explicit administrator email allowlist.

   1) Create a Supabase project and get API values
   - Create a project at https://supabase.com/
   - In the Supabase dashboard, open **Project Settings → API**
   - Copy **Project URL** as `SUPABASE_URL`
   - Copy **Project API keys → anon public** as `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

   2) Enable Email auth
   - Go to **Authentication → Providers**
   - Enable **Email** (Email/Password)
   - Create or invite administrator accounts from the Supabase dashboard. Public sign-up is not exposed by PaperPilot.

   3) Configure redirect URLs (important)
   - Go to **Authentication → URL Configuration**
   - Set **Site URL** to your site origin, for example:
   - Local: `http://localhost:7191`
   - Production: `https://your-domain.com`
   - Add allowed callback URLs in **Redirect URLs** (at least include your site root), for example:
   - `http://localhost:7191/`
   - `https://your-domain.com/`

   4) Configure auth in PaperPilot
   Copy and edit environment variables in the project root:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Fill in SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, and PAPERPILOT_ALLOWED_EMAILS
   ```
   Restart the server. Missing or partial production auth configuration stops startup instead of opening the API anonymously. For isolated local development only, set `PAPERPILOT_ENV=development`, `PAPERPILOT_AUTH_MODE=disabled`, and bind the published port to `127.0.0.1`.

   **Security notes**
   - Use only the `anon public` key; never put `service_role` keys into `.env` or ship them to the browser
   - This project injects `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` into pages for browser-side login, which is expected
   - Every email in `PAPERPILOT_ALLOWED_EMAILS` is an administrator of the same shared library; PaperPilot does not provide tenant isolation
   - Set `PAPERPILOT_COOKIE_SECURE=true` when the site is served over HTTPS


5. **Run the Application**

   Then start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Access the web interface at `http://localhost:7191` (default port).

   **Custom Launch Arguments:**
   `app.py` supports the following command-line arguments for custom configuration:

   | Argument | Default | Description |
   | :--- | :--- | :--- |
   | `--papers-dir` | `./papers` | Path to the papers directory (absolute or relative) |
   | `--host` | `0.0.0.0` | Server listening address |
   | `--port` | `7191` | Server listening port |

   The maintained Compose file uses the v0.4.0 Web and translation-worker images. The Web service binds only `127.0.0.1:7191`; Worker port `7192` is internal only. Both run as non-root users. Copy `.env.example` to the deployment directory, create a random Worker token file, and create the staging directory before running `docker compose up -d`.

   ```bash
   install -d -m 2770 /mnt/raid1/projects/paperpilot/data/staging/translation
   openssl rand -hex 32 > /mnt/raid1/projects/paperpilot/deploy/paperpilot-worker.token
   chmod 0640 /mnt/raid1/projects/paperpilot/deploy/paperpilot-worker.token
   ```

   The Worker receives only `/work/jobs` and its token secret. It does not mount the paper library, SQLite database, `.env`, or Docker socket. Successful output is validated and atomically copied into the paper library by the Web service.

### Upgrading from v0.3.0

v0.4.0 moves BabelDOC into an isolated Worker and upgrades it to 0.6.4. There is no paper-storage migration. Add the staging mount, Worker token, and Worker service shown in `docker-compose.yaml`, then start both services. The additive `translation_jobs` table is created automatically. To roll back, stop both services and pin the Web image back to the v0.3.0 digest; the extra table is backward compatible.

### Upgrading from v0.2.0

v0.3.0 stores category files in deterministic ID directories under
`/data/papers/.categories/`. Stop PaperPilot before migrating, then run:

```bash
python -m paperpilot.migrations.category_storage \
  --papers-dir /data/papers --db /app/db/paperpilot.db --dry-run
python -m paperpilot.migrations.category_storage \
  --papers-dir /data/papers --db /app/db/paperpilot.db \
  --backup-dir /backups --apply
```

Keep the printed manifest path. To roll back while the service is stopped:

```bash
python -m paperpilot.migrations.category_storage \
  --papers-dir /data/papers --db /app/db/paperpilot.db \
  --rollback /data/papers/.paperpilot-migrations/<manifest>.json
```

Startup fails closed when a legacy, mixed, or interrupted category layout is detected.
   | `--debug` | `False` | Enable debug mode (for development) |

   **Typical Configuration Examples:**

   - **Specify Data Storage Location** (useful for mounted data volumes):
     ```bash
     python app.py --papers-dir /mnt/data/my_papers
     ```

   - **Change Server Port** (if the default port is occupied):
     ```bash
     python app.py --port 8080
     ```

   - **Allow Local Access Only** (for enhanced security):
     ```bash
     python app.py --host 127.0.0.1
     ```

## 🧪 Testing

Install the test dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install -e ".[test]"
```

Run the fast unit tests, including mocked arXiv behavior:
```bash
uv run pytest -q -m "not integration"
```

Run only the tests that access the live arXiv API and validate the real response format:
```bash
uv run pytest -q -m integration
```

Run the arXiv-related tests directly:
```bash
uv run pytest -q tests/test_arxiv_api_interactions.py
```

The `integration` tests require network access and depend on arXiv availability. If arXiv is temporarily unavailable or rate-limited, rerun them later.

## ⚙️ Configuration

PaperPilot is designed to be configurable directly from the Web UI.

### arXiv-only proxy
Set `ARXIV_PROXY` when only arXiv metadata/PDF requests should use a proxy:

```bash
ARXIV_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890
```

Scheme-specific overrides are also supported: `ARXIV_HTTP_PROXY` and
`ARXIV_HTTPS_PROXY`. These variables are applied only to `arxiv.org` and
`export.arxiv.org`; DBLP, LLM providers, Supabase, MinerU, and other backend
requests are not proxied by this setting.

When baking the value into a Docker image:

```bash
docker build --build-arg ARXIV_PROXY=http://host.docker.internal:7890 -t paperpilot .
```

### Agentic Settings
Navigate to the **Settings** tab to configure:
- **LLM Provider**: Set your API Key, Base URL, and Model Name (e.g., GPT-4, Qwen, DeepSeek).
- **MinerU**: Choose between Local instance or Cloud API.

### Daily ArXiv
Configure your research interests:
- **Categories**: Select ArXiv categories to monitor.
- **Keywords**: Define keywords for filtering and highlighting.
- **Schedule**: Set the automatic fetch interval.
- **Max Papers per Day**: Cap the total number of papers fetched per arXiv date. The recommended default is `50`.
- **Max New Papers per Category per Fetch**: Limit how many new papers each configured category can add in a single sync, so repeated syncs can pick up papers released later in the day.
- **Replacement Candidate Limit**: When a category quota is already full, screen a small number of newer candidates for possible replacement.

The core paper filtering pipeline is:

1. **arXiv category and date filter**: PaperPilot queries each configured category with `cat:<category>`, sorted by newest submissions, and keeps only papers that belong to the target arXiv announcement date. Already downloaded Daily ArXiv papers are skipped.
2. **Keyword hard filter**: If **Keywords** is not empty, a paper must match at least one configured keyword in its title or abstract. Matching is case-insensitive and normalizes punctuation and whitespace.
3. **Quota filter**: The remaining candidates must fit both the daily global budget and the per-category budget. Each sync also respects **Max New Papers per Category per Fetch**.
4. **Institution tier hard filter**: Because arXiv metadata does not provide affiliations, PaperPilot downloads the candidate PDF first, extracts first-page affiliations through the configured LLM, then applies the selected quality strategy as a hard gate:
   - `strict`: keep Tier S/A papers; reject Tier B/C and unknown institutions.
   - `balanced`: keep Tier S/A/B papers and allow unknown institutions; reject Tier C.
   - `discovery`: keep Tier S/A/B/C papers and allow unknown institutions.
   Papers rejected by this gate are not saved, summarized, or shown in Daily ArXiv.
5. **AI enrichment**: Accepted papers get thumbnails, affiliation/country/project-link metadata, and an LLM-generated brief summary and keyword tags when the Daily ArXiv LLM configuration is available.
6. **Replacement screening when full**: When a category is already full, PaperPilot can evaluate a small number of newer candidates against already kept papers and replace a weaker paper only if the LLM judges the candidate clearly better.

Daily ArXiv can split the daily paper budget in two ways:

- **Custom category ratios**: In **arXiv Categories**, set per-category percentages when you want direct control, for example `cs.CV 60%`, `cs.AI 25%`, `cs.LG 15%`. Custom ratios must total exactly `100%`; PaperPilot will warn you if the total is above or below 100%.
- **Automatic weighted split**: If no custom ratios are configured, PaperPilot keeps the existing weighted strategy.

The automatic strategy uses incremental weighted quotas when fetching multiple configured categories:

1. **Weighted reservation**: PaperPilot dynamically recalculates a per-category quota from the current **Categories** list every time settings are saved or fetches run. High-volume AI categories such as `cs.AI`, `cs.CV`, and `cs.LG` receive slightly lower weights, while smaller systems/infrastructure categories such as `cs.DC`, `cs.OS`, `cs.NI`, and `cs.PF` receive higher weights so they are not crowded out.
2. **Incremental intake**: Each sync only admits up to **Max New Papers per Category per Fetch** new papers per category. This avoids filling the whole daily budget during an early sync before arXiv has released papers throughout the day.
3. **LLM replacement screening**: When a category quota is already full, PaperPilot can send newer candidates and the existing papers in that category to the configured LLM. The payload includes paper metadata, abstracts, affiliations, countries, and the current **Institution tiers** configuration. The LLM should replace an existing paper only when the candidate is clearly more valuable; institution tier is used only as one signal when quality and relevance are otherwise comparable.

This keeps niche categories visible, avoids consuming all daily slots too early, and lets later high-value papers replace weaker earlier picks.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Multi-User Support**: The current version of PaperPilot is designed for individuals or small teams and does not yet fully support multi-tenancy. While it supports authentication via Supabase, all users share the same backend configuration and paper library. It is recommended to deploy in a private network or trusted environment.
- **BabelDOC Translation**: The English-Chinese parallel translation feature based on BabelDOC has high memory consumption and a long processing time. It is recommended to use this feature primarily for papers that require intensive reading.
